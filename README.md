# CoinMarketCap-Chatbot
A chatbot for pulling real-time aggregated cryptocurrency data from coinmarketcap.com

This is a project originating from a graduate course in Cognitive Computing. The application leverages the IBM
Watson Assistant Service for back end natural language processing. Data is sourced from coinmarketcap.com via
the public API. Unfortunately, the Public API is migrating to their Professional API on December 4th, so the 
API calls in this application will no longer work, but the code serves as a demonstration and example to those
interested in developing a similar application using any IBM Watson API, or similar service offered by Microsoft, etc.

See the associated project poster PDF for more information on the application architecture.
